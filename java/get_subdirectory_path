Problem:
Extract from relative path file/subdirectory path

BBF/dependencies/dependencies.xml -> /dependencies/dependencies.xml
BBF/dependencies -> /dependencies
BBF/dependencies/user%dragan/dependencies.xml -> /user%dragan/dependencies/dependencies.xml

Relative path starts with parent directory and goal is to get subdirectory path

Solution:

^([A-Z a-z 0-9 \_\.\!\@\#\%\&\^\$\(\)\-\+\{\}\[\]\;\'\,\.\~\`]+)(.*)$

Explanation:

This regex will match string that has two substrings.
First (subtring on start of string) will contain alphanumerical characters and special characters that are allowed to be used in filenames:
_ . ! @ # % &amp; ^ $ ( ) - + { } [ ] ; ' , . ~ `
Second (subtring on the end of string) will contain any character and any number of characters.

We will get our goal by replace string with second group.($2)

WARNING:

Be aware that special characters must be escaped.

This expression can be different for some environments.

For example in ant xml file you would have to escape $ sign with $$
For xml files instead of & you will have to use &amp;
